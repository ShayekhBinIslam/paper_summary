            DNNs have many AI applications. They deliver SoTA <b>accuracy</b>. But they are <b>computationally
            costly</b>. We need techniques for efficient processing without sacrificing accuracy and increasing
            hardware cost.

            Topic of this article is recent advances in efficient processing of DNNs.
            Main aspects of this article are design considerations of DNNs; hardware evaluation of DNN hardware
            with benchmarks and comparison metrics; hardware architecture and platform trade-offs; evaluation of
            hardware optimized DNN algorithm design technique; and recent implementation trend and oppotunities

            Applications of DNNs: self-driving cars, cancer detection, complex game-playing. DNNs have super-human
            accuracy in most of these domains. This high accuracy required highly costly computation using general-
            purpose compute engines like GPUs and some specialized accelerator like TPUs.

            The earlier approaches utilized hand-crafted features or expert-designed
            rules. But the recent approaches result more effective representation of an input space. Here, the DNNs
            extract high-level features from a large amount of raw sensory data after using statistical learning.
